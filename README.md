The [billstclair/elm-html-template](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-html-tempate/latest) package allows you to generate HTML from JSON templates and dictionaries to fill in variables in the templates.

One of the problems I find with Elm is that the HTML is compiled into the JavaScript code for a web site. This package is the basis of a much more data-driven HTML generation mechanism.
