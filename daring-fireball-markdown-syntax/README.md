`index.html` in this directory is a local copy of the ["Syntax" page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) from John Gruber's [documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) of his Markdown syntax. I put this here to ensure that I'd always have a copy close at hand. It's his copyright, and if he complains, I'll remove it.
